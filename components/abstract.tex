Turbulent flows, characterized by their complex and chaotic nature, play a pivotal role in various engineering and natural systems. Understanding and analyzing these phenomena is essential for optimizing design, predicting crucial outcomes and addressing real-world challenges. Therefore, obtaining accurate, efficient and rapid predictions of turbulent behaviors is of utmost importance. Data-driven methods such as deep learning algorithms are being increasingly implemented to speed up flow predictions compared to numerical solvers. However, these models tend to have poor generalization capabilities and are often restricted to simple geometries on structured grids. Hence, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based surrogate model is proposed to handle unstructured mesh data of turbulent flow simulations. The underlying goal of this research is to leverage the predictions of the surrogate model to perform a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the parameter space that governs the performance of a High-speed Orienting Momentum with Enhanced Reversibility (HOMER) nozzle operating in turbulent flow conditions.
